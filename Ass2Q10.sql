/*

Functions are designed to compute values, while Stored Procedures are designed to execute business logic and modify the database.

Use a Function if you need to calculate a value (like a formatted date or a math calculation) that you want to use repeatedly inside other SELECT queries.

Use a Stored Procedure if you are processing a transaction, updating records, or running a complex batch job that involves multiple steps and error handling.
